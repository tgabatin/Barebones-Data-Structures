# Barebones-Data-Structures

This is a project that implements various data structures in C++ to as a fun way to demonstrate my knowledge of their architecture. 

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
DataStructures/
├── Arrays/
│   ├── Array.h
│   ├── Array.cpp
│   ├── Main.cpp
│   └── Makefile
├── Linked Lists/
│   ├── LinkedList.h
│   ├── LinkedList.cpp
│   ├── Main.cpp
│   └── Makefile
├── ...
├── README.md
└── Makefile

Each subsequent subdirectory corresponds to the data structure, and contains a header file, source file, and 'Main.cpp' file that demonstrates the usage of the data structure within various programs.

The top level 'Makefile' can otherwise be used to build all of the data structure examples at once, and each subdirectory within the corresponding folder also contains its own relevant 'Makefile' to build the individual example.

## Implemented Data Structures
Below is a list of the data structures (to be) implemented within this project:

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Graphs
* Hash Tables
* Heaps
* Tries
* Sets
* Maps
* Priority Queues
* Dequeus (Double Ended Queues)
* Bit Arrays (Bitsets)
* Bloom Filters
* Disjoint Sets (Union-Find)
* Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)
* Segment Trees
* Red-Black Trees
* AVL Trees

## Building and Running
In order to build the examples, navigate to the relevant subdirectory for the data structure that you wish to test. Run 'make' within the command line, which compiles the example and creates the executable.

To run the example, simply run the executable file. The 'Main.cpp' file for each example will demonstrate the usage of the data structure, and can be modified or extended as needed. 

## Conclusion

This project is to demonstrate my understanding & grow my knowledge of data structures & algorithms, and show my ability to be able to create it from a barebones structure instead of relying on internal lirbaries. My hope is that this project will be useful to others who are also learning about data structures & algorithms, and it inspires them to create projects of their own or bring about their own understanding through practice.
